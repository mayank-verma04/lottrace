## 💡 Architecture Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Reason |
|------|---------|--------|
| Setup | Knex over Prisma | Recursive CTEs for trace engine, JS-first (no TS type gen), tighter SQL control |
| Setup | PostgreSQL only (no MongoDB) | JSONB covers flexible KDE payloads; avoids dual-DB complexity; recursive CTEs for trace |
| Setup | JavaScript not TypeScript | Team preference; JSDoc used for critical type hints |
| Setup | pnpm workspaces | Monorepo with shared configs |
| Setup | BullMQ for jobs | Redis-native, used anyway for caching; handles import/export/hash jobs |
